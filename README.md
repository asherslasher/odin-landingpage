For my second project, I will be creating my first Landing Page. As you could tell from my first project, I am a huge fan of Halloween and all things spooky. I will be maintaining that theme in this project as well.

For this project, I am provided with a PNG image of what my landing page should look like. From there, I will applying my new knowledge of CSS and continuing to apply my current skills working with HTML to create my Landing Page.

After finishing this second project, I am reflecting on my work and I am noticing I need to work on my confidence using Git and GitHub.
